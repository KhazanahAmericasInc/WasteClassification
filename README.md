# WasteClassification

Prerequisites:
* To use fast.ai library on anaconda, install pytorch

Note:
Due to exceeding GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB, the exported keras model h5 file is here https://drive.google.com/open?id=18LgNTAl46a3vXHq-m9NFPCxuF8ZiLcuv

Recourses:

* Get data from https://github.com/garythung/trashnet/blob/master/data/dataset-resized.zip
* Data preprocessing part partially depends on Vishcam's waste classifier project https://github.com/KhazanahAmericasInc/waste-classifier
* Model training (PyTorch version) part partially depends on Collin Ching's waste sorter project https://github.com/collindching/Waste-Sorter
